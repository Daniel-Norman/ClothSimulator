ClothSimulator
==============

Simulates a cloth-like material using Verlet integration.

Created following guidelines of this tutorial: http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/simulate-tearable-cloth-and-ragdolls-with-simple-verlet-integration--gamedev-519

Added features include making the material appear filled in, rather than just dots and connecting lines, color-based stress indication, and cutting (in adition to tearing) of the cloth.
