ClothSimulator
==============

Simulates a cloth-like material using Verlet integration.

Created following guidelines of this tutorial: http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/simulate-tearable-cloth-and-ragdolls-with-simple-verlet-integration--gamedev-519

Added features include making the material appear filled in, rather than just dots and connecting lines, and color-based stress indication.
